= Training a model 
Now that you know how the Jupyter notebook environment works, you are ready to train a model.

In your notebook environment, open the `1_experiment_train.ipynb` file and follow the instructions in the notebook. The instructions guide you through some simple data exploration, experimentation, and model training tasks.

When you save the model you convert the model to the portable ONNX format. ONNX allows you to transfer models between frameworks with minimal preparation and without the need for rewriting the models.
