Red Hat ships several notebook images that are built and supported.  The *Notebook image* section will allow you to choose one of these or any custom images an administrator has set up for you.  Today, we'll be using the *Tensorflow* image which has the necessary libraries for this workshop.

* Choose the latest *Tensorflow* image.
