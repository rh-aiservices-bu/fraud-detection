[id='creating-connections-to-storage']
= (Optional) Creating connections to your own S3-compatible object storage

NOTE: Skip this procedure if you completed the steps in xref:running-a-script-to-install-storage.adoc[Running a script to install local object storage buckets and create connections].

If you have existing S3-compatible storage buckets that you want to use for this {deliverable}, you must create a connection to one storage bucket for saving your data and models. If you want to complete the pipelines section of this {deliverable}, create another connection to a different storage bucket for saving pipeline artifacts.

.Prerequisites

To create connections to your existing S3-compatible storage buckets, you need the following credential information for the storage buckets:

* Endpoint URL
* Access key
* Secret key
* Region
* Bucket name

If you do not have this information, contact your storage administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a connection for saving your data and models:

.. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to the page for your project.

.. Click the *Connections* tab, and then click *Create connection*.

.. In the *Add connection* modal, for the *Connection type* select *S3 compatible object storage - v1*.

.. Complete the *Add connection* form and name your connection *My Storage*. This connection is for saving your personal work, including data and models.

.. Click *Create*.

. Create a connection for saving pipeline artifacts:
+
NOTE: If you do not intend to complete the pipelines section of the {deliverable}, you can skip this step.

.. Click *Add connection*.

.. Complete the form and name your connection *Pipeline Artifacts*.

.. Click *Create*.


.Verification

In the *Connections* tab for the project, check to see that your connections are listed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster uses self-signed certificates, your {productname-short} administrator might need to provide a certificate authority (CA) to securely connect to the S3 object storage, as described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/latest/html/installing_and_uninstalling_openshift_ai_self-managed/working-with-certificates_certs#accessing-s3-compatible-object-storage-with-self-signed-certificates_certs[Accessing S3-compatible object storage with self-signed certificates^] (Self-Managed).

.Next steps

* Decide whether you want to complete the pipelines section of this {deliverable}. With OpenShift AI pipelines, you can automate the execution of your notebooks and Python code. You can run long training jobs or retrain your models on a schedule without having to manually run them in a notebook.
+
If you want to complete the pipelines section of this {deliverable}, go to xref:enabling-ai-pipelines.adoc[Enabling AI pipelines].

* Decide whether you want to complete the _Distributing training jobs with the Training Operator_ section of this {deliverable}. In that section, you implement a distributed training job by using Kueue for managing job resources.
//+
//NOTE: The _Distributing training jobs with the Training Operator_ section of this {deliverable} is not supported if you are using the {org-name} Developer Sandbox.
