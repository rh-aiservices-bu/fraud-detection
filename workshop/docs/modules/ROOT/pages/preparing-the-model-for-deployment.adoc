= Preparing the model for deployment

[role="_abstract"]
After you train a model, you can deploy it by using the {productname-short} model serving capabilities. Model serving in {productname-short} requires that you store models in object storage so that the model server pods can access them.

To prepare a model for deployment, you must move the model from your workbench to your S3-compatible object storage. Use the connection that you created in the xref:storing-data-with-connections.adoc[Storing data with connections] section and upload the model from a notebook.

.Prerequisites

* You created the `My Storage` connection and have added it to your workbench.

.Procedure

. In your JupyterLab environment, open the `2_save_model.ipynb` file.

. Follow the instructions in the notebook to make the model accessible in storage.

.Verification

When you have completed the notebook instructions, the `models/fraud/1/model.onnx` file is in your object storage and it is ready for your model server to use.
