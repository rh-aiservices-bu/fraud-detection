= Creating data connections to your own S3-compatible object storage

NOTE: If you do not have your own s3-compatible storage, or if you want to use a disposable local Minio instance instead, skip this section and follow the steps in xref:running-a-script-to-install-storage.adoc[Running a script to install local object storage buckets and create data connections].

.Prerequisite

To create data connections to your existing S3-compatible storage buckets, you need the following credential information for the storage buckets:

* Endpoint URL
* Access key
* Secret key
* Region
* Bucket name

If you don't have this information, contact your storage administrator.

.Procedures

Create data connections to your two storage buckets.

*Create a data connection for saving your data and models*

. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to the page for your data science project.

. Click the *Data connections* tab, and then click *Add data connection*.
