= Creating data connections to your own S3-compatible object storage

If you have existing S3-compatible storage buckets that you want to use for this {deliverable}, you must create a data connection to one storage bucket for saving your data and models. If you want to complete the pipelines section of this {deliverable}, create another data connection to a different storage bucket for saving pipeline artifacts.

NOTE: If you do not have your own s3-compatible storage, or if you want to use a disposable local Minio instance instead, skip this section and follow the steps in xref:running-a-script-to-install-storage.adoc[Running a script to install local object storage buckets and create data connections].   The provided script automatically completes the following tasks for you: creates a Minio instance in your project, creates two storage buckets in that Minio instance, creates two data connections in your project, one for each bucket and both using the same credentials, and installs required network policies for service mesh functionality. 

.Prerequisites

To create data connections to your existing S3-compatible storage buckets, you need the following credential information for the storage buckets:

* Endpoint URL
* Access key
* Secret key
* Region
* Bucket name

If you don't have this information, contact your storage administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a data connection for saving your data and models:

.. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to the page for your data science project.

.. Click the *Data connections* tab, and then click *Add data connection*.

.. Fill out the *Add data connection* form and name your connection *My Storage*. This connection is for saving your personal work, including data and models. 
+
NOTE: Skip the *Connected workbench* item. You add data connections to a workbench in a later section.

.. Click *Add data connection*.

. Create a data connection for saving pipeline artifacts:
+
NOTE: If you do not intend to complete the pipelines section of the {deliverable}, you can skip this step.

.. Click *Add data connection*.

.. Fill out the form and name your connection *Pipeline Artifacts*.
+
NOTE: Skip the *Connected workbench* item. You add data connections to a workbench in a later section.

.. Click *Add data connection*.


.Verification

In the *Data connections* tab for the project, check to see that your data connections are listed.
