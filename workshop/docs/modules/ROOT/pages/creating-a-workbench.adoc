= Creating a workbench and selecting a workbench image

A workbench is an instance of your development and experimentation environment. When you create a workbench, you select a workbench image that is optimized with the tools and libraries that you need for developing models. 

.Prerequisites

* You created a `My Storage` connection as described in xref:storing-data-with-connections.adoc[Storing data with connections].

* If you intend to complete the pipelines section of this {deliverable}, you configured a pipeline server as described in xref:enabling-data-science-pipelines.adoc[Enabling data science pipelines].


.Procedure

. Navigate to the project detail page for the data science project that you created in xref:setting-up-your-data-science-project.adoc[Setting up your data science project].

. Click the *Workbenches* tab, and then click the *Create workbench* button.
