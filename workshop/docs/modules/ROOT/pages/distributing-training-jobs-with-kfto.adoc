= Distributing training jobs with the Training Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The Training Operator is a tool for scalable distributed training of machine learning (ML) models created with various ML frameworks, such as PyTorch.

*NOTE:* Distributed training in {productname-short} uses the {org-name} build of Kueue for admission and scheduling. Before you run a distributed training example in this tutorial, complete the setup tasks in xref:setting-up-kueue-resources.adoc[Setting up Kueue resources].

In your notebook environment, open the `7_distributed_training_kfto.ipynb` file and follow the instructions directly in the notebook. The instructions guide you through setting authentication, initializing the Training Operator client, and submitting a `PyTorchJob`.

You can also view the complete Python code in the `kfto-scripts/train_pytorch_cpu.py` file.
