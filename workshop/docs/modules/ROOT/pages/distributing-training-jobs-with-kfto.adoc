= Distributing training jobs with the Training Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The Training Operator is a tool for scalable distributed training of machine learning (ML) models created with various ML frameworks, such as `PyTorch`.

You can use the Training Operator to distribute the training of a machine learning model across many hardware resources. 

In your notebook environment, open the `9_distributed_training_kfto.ipynb` file and follow the instructions directly in the notebook. The instructions guide you through setting authentication, initializing the Training Operator client, and submitting a `PyTorchJob`.

Optionally, you can view the complete Python code in the `kfto-scripts/train_pytorch_cpu.py` file.
