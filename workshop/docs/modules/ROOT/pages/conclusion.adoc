== Conclusion

Congratulations. In this {deliverable}, you learned how to incorporate data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning into an OpenShift development workflow.

You used an example fraud detection model and completed the following tasks:

* Explored a pre-trained fraud detection model by using a Jupyter notebook.
* Deployed the model by using {productname-short} model serving.
* Refined and trained the model by using automated pipelines.
* Learned how to train the model by using Ray, a distributed computing framework.
