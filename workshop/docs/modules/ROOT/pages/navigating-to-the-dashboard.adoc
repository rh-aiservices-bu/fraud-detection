= Navigating to the {productname-short} dashboard

.Procedure

. How you open the {productname-short} dashboard depends on your OpenShift environment:

** *If you are using the {org-name} Developer Sandbox*:
+
After you log in to the Sandbox, in the {productname-long} card, click *Try It*.

** *If you are using your own OpenShift cluster*:
+
.. After you log in to the OpenShift console, click the application launcher icon on the header.

.. When prompted, log in to the {productname-short} dashboard by using your OpenShift credentials. {productname-short} uses the same credentials as OpenShift for the dashboard, notebooks, and all other components.

The {productname-short} dashboard shows the *Home* page.

NOTE: You can navigate back to the OpenShift console by clicking the application launcher to access the OpenShift console.

For now, stay in the {productname-short} dashboard.
