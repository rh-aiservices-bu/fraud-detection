[role="_abstract"]
After you deploy the model, you can test its API endpoints.

.Procedure

. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to the project details page and click the *Deployments* tab.

. Take note of the model's Inference endpoint URL. You need this information when you test the model API.
+
If the *Inference endpoint* field has an *Internal endpoint details* link, click the link to open a text box that shows the URL details, and then take note of the *restUrl* value.
