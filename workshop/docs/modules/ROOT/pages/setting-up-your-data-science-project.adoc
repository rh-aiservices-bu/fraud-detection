= Setting up your data science project

To implement a data science workflow, you must create a data science project (as described in the following procedure). Projects allow you and your team to organize and collaborate on resources within separated namespaces. From a project you can create multiple workbenches, each with their own IDE environment (for example, JupyterLab), and each with their own connections and cluster storage. In addition, the workbenches can share models and data with pipelines and model servers.

.Prerequisites

Before you begin, log in to *{productname-long}*.

.Procedure

. On the navigation menu, select *Data science projects*. This page lists any existing projects that you have access to. From this page, you can select an existing project (if any) or create a new one.

+
NOTE: It is possible to start a Jupyter notebook by clicking the *Launch standalone workbench* button, selecting a notebook image, and clicking *Start server*. However, it would be a one-off Jupyter notebook run in isolation.

. If you are using your own OpenShift cluster, click *Create project*. 
+
NOTE: If you are using the {org-name} Developer Sandbox, you are provided with a default data science project (for example, `myname-dev`). Select it and skip over the next step to the *Verification* section.

. Enter a display name and description.

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

You can see your project's initial state. Individual tabs provide more information about the project components and project access permissions:

** *Workbenches* are instances of your development and experimentation environment. They typically contain IDEs, such as JupyterLab, RStudio, and Visual Studio Code.

** *Pipelines* contain the data science pipelines that are executed within the project.

** *Models* allow you to quickly serve a trained model for real-time inference. You can have multiple model servers per data science project. One model server can host multiple models.

** *Cluster storage* is a persistent volume that retains the files and data you're working on within a workbench. A workbench has access to one or more cluster storage instances.

** *Connections* contain configuration parameters that are required to connect to a data source, such as an S3 object bucket.

** *Permissions* define which users and groups can access the project.
