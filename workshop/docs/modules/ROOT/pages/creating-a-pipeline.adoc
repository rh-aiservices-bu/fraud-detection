= Creating a pipeline

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a pipeline by using the GUI pipeline editor. This pipeline automates the notebook workflow that you used earlier to train a model and save it to S3 storage.

.Prerequisites

* You configured a pipeline server as described in xref:enabling-ai-pipelines.adoc[Enabling AI pipelines].
* If you configured the pipeline server after you created your workbench, you stopped and then started your workbench.

.Procedure

. Open your workbench's JupyterLab environment. If the launcher is not visible, click *+* to open it.

. Click *Pipeline Editor*.

+
You have created a blank pipeline.

. Set the default runtime image for when you run your notebook or Python code.

.. In the pipeline editor, click *Open Panel*.

.. Select the *Pipeline Properties* tab.

.. In the *Pipeline Properties* panel, scroll down to *Generic Node Defaults* and *Runtime Image*. Set the value to `Runtime | Tensorflow | Cuda | Python 3.12`.

. Select *File* -> *Save Pipeline*.

.Verification

* In the JupyterLab file browser, the pipeline file (for example, `untitled.pipeline`) appears in your working directory.
