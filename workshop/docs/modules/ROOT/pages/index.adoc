== Introduction

:rhoai-version: main (the latest)
// for the downstream tutorial, change the value of rhoai-version to match the git-version value in the importing-files-into-jupyter.adoc file

Welcome to the fraud detection tutoiral! In this {deliverable}, you will learn how to incorporate data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML) into an OpenShift development workflow. You will not need to install anything on your computer.

You will use an example fraud detection model to complete the following tasks:

* Explore the pre-trained model using a Jupyter notebook.
* Deploy the model by using {productname-short} model serving.
* Refine and train the model using automated pipelines.
* Train the model using Ray, a distributed computing framework.

== About the example fraud detection model

The example fraud detection model monitors credit card transactions for potential fraudulent activity. It analyzes the following credit card transaction details:

* The geographical distance from the previous credit card transaction.
* The price of the current transaction, compared to the median price of all the user's transactions.
* Whether the user completed the transaction by using the hardware chip in the credit card, by entering a PIN number, or by making an online purchase.

Based on this data, the model outputs the likelihood of the transaction being fraudulent.

== Prerequisites

* You must have access to an OpenShift cluster where {productname-long} is installed. 
+
If you do not have access to a cluster that includes an instance of {productname-short}, see the https://developers.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-ai/download[{productname-long} page on the {org-name} Developer website]. There, you can create an account and access the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/sandbox[*free {org-name} Developer Sandbox*] or you can learn how to install {productname-short} on *your own OpenShift cluster*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster uses self-signed certificates your {productname-short} administrator must add self-signed certificates for {productname-short}.

See the following for more information: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/latest/html/installing_and_uninstalling_openshift_ai_self-managed/working-with-certificates_certs[Working with certificates^] (Self-Managed) or link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_cloud_service/1/html/installing_and_uninstalling_openshift_ai_cloud_service/working-with-certificates_certs[Working with certificates^] (Cloud Service).

* Make sure that the version of this tutorial matches the {productname-short} version on your cluster.
+
* **{productname-long} {rhoai-version} is the version described in this {deliverable}.**
+
. How to locate the {productname-short} version for your cluster:
.. Log in to the {productname-short} dashboard.
.. In the top navigation bar, click the help icon (image:projects/rhoai-help-icon.png[Help icon]) and then select *About*.
+
.. The *About* page shows the installed version.
. Check the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs[{productname-long} Supported Configurations] page to verify that your installed version is a supported version.

. If this version of the tutorial does not match the installed version, access the matching version of the tutorial by navigating to the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed[top-level {productname-long} documentation page] and selecting the matching version from the drop-down list.
